Quadro
==========

In order to manage my time as  efficient as possible I usually divide my tasks into four different boxes, often referred to as four quadrant planning. I couldn't find any applications out there that was good enough for this and at the same time was visually pleasing, so I made my own app, **Quadro!**

It will be live shortly, just need to add an infinite amount of features.
